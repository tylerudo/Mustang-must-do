    In 1838 Sir Charles Wheatstone was the first to describe stereopsis
  </h1>
  <p> Sir Charles Wheatstone was the first to describe stereopsis and was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his explanation of binocular vision, which soon led him to the invitation of stereoscope. His research determined that the brain combined two photographs of the same object taken from the two differnt points to make the image appear to have a sense of depth and immersion. This technology enabled Wheatstone to create the earliest type of stereoscope. It used a pair of mirrors at 45 degree angles to the user's eyes, each reflecting a picture located off to the side. Sir Charles Wheatstone started the whole world of VR. Creating this set up endless opportunities for people to discover the way VR works and how to make it better for the furture. The stereoscope was the first type of VR that was created and without it we might not have VR.</p>

  In 1956 Cinematographer Morton Heilig created Sensorama, the first VR machine
</h2>
<p> Cinematographer Morton Heilig created Sensorama. This was the very first VR machine. It was a very large booth that could fit up to four people at a time. It combined multiple technologies to stimulate all of the senses. Including full colour 3D video, audio, vibrations, smell and atmospheric effect(like wind).This was done using scent producers, a vibrating chair, stereo speakers and a stereoscopic 3D screen.Heilig beilieved this was the future of the cinema. About six movies were made for this machine. The Sensorama was the start of the VR machine. The Sensorama was created to make films better and more relistic. Even though there was not a lot of movies made, this VR machine was a huge step in VR's future.</p>

  In 1968 Sutherland, with his student Bob Sproull, created the first virtual reality HMD, named The Sword of Damocles.
</h3>
<p>  Sutherland and Bob Sproull, created the first virtual reality HMD, named The Sword of Damocles.The head mount connected to a computer not a camera and was very primitive as it could only show simple virtual wire-frame shapes. The 3D models changed perspective when the user moved their head due to the tracking system. It never was really never developed outside the lab because it was way too heavy and not comfortable to wear. You had to be strapped in because it was hanging from the ceiling. Sutherlan and Bob Sproull created another VR machine, but besides it being a machine you go in they made one you wear. Like the ones now you put it on your head and put the goggles on. The only problem was that it had to hang from the ceiling. This VR headset was the start of VR's becomimg helmets. </p>
<h4>
  In 1985 Jaron Lanier and Thomas Zimmerman founded VPL Research, Inc
</h4>
<p> Jaron Lanier and Thomas Zimmerman founded VPL Research, Inc. The company is known as the first to sell VR goggles and gloves. They developed a lot of equipment for VR, such as DataGlove EyePhone HMD and the audio sphere. Jaron Lanier and Thomas Zimmerman kept the helemt idea with VR but also added gloves. This allowed people to interact in the game easier. It made it where whatever your hands did thats what happened in the VR. This still is going on today and also there is joysticks now. The gloves at the time was a game changer for the world of VR. This company ended up creating many different sets of equipment for VR.</p>
<h5>
  In 2018 VR is advancing
</h5>
<p> At Facebook F8, Oculus demonstrated a new headset prototype, the Half Dome. This is a varifocal headset with a 140 degrees field of vision. VR has advanced in many ways and now is being used in so much more things then just to play games. VR is now very east to access across the world. With all the new things being explored in VR allows for expansion in the VR world. Now Vr is very advanced and used for many differnet things. Now games, movies, work, etc can all be done by VR. VR has and will keep helping us in the future.</p>
